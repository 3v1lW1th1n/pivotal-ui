## Goals

The goals for the 6.0 release are:

- Remove React Bootstrap Dependency
  - This should make it much easier for teams to choose their version of React without causing dependency conflicts.
  - This will also make it easier in the future to use non-Bootstrap designs.
- Add a couple new React Components

## The Big Changes

- Alert: The `dismissable` prop is now just a boolean. If you want a function that is called on dismissal, use the `onDimiss` prop.
- Modals: The `bsSize` prop has been renamed to `size`.
- React Bootstrap: Alerts, Grids, Modals and Tabs are now entirely different code paths. The goal was to replace all old functionality, but undocumented behavior may have changed.
