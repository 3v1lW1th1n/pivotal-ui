```jsx harmony
::title=Complex example
::description=Alerts are also used to bring important notes to a user's attention. If the content of your alert is a little more complicated, we would recommend using headings coupled with the content.
<InfoAlert>
  <h5 className="em-high mtn">You should know...</h5>
  <p>There are some things you should note. Just in case you didn't figure it out already.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>thing 1</li>
    <li>thing 2</li>
  </ul>
</InfoAlert>
```

```jsx harmony
::title=Alert links
::description=If you want to include a link in your alert, use the class `pui-alert-link`.
<WarningAlert>
  <h5 className="em-high mtn">Important Link</h5>
  <p>
    It is very important that you <a className="pui-alert-link" href="http://www.example.com/">click here</a>
  </p>
</WarningAlert>
```

```jsx harmony
::title=Dismissible alert example
::description=Add the `dismissable` property to add a close button to the alert.
<SuccessAlert dismissable>Everything is wonderful</SuccessAlert>
```

```jsx harmony
::title=Callback on dismiss example
::description=If you want a callback to be called when the close button is clicked, set the `onDismiss` property to that callback.
const callback = () => alert('Dismissed!');
<InfoAlert onDismiss={callback} dismissable>with callback</InfoAlert>
```

```jsx harmony
::title=Alerts with icons example
::description=If you want an icon to be displayed, set the `withIcon` property. Alerts use the [Iconography](/icons) component when using `withIcon` or `dismissable`. If you use those props, you will need to add an svg loader.
<div>
  <SuccessAlert withIcon>success</SuccessAlert>
  <InfoAlert withIcon>info</InfoAlert>
  <WarningAlert withIcon>warning</WarningAlert>
  <ErrorAlert withIcon>error</ErrorAlert>
</div>
```

```jsx harmony
::title=Dismissable alert with an icon
<WarningAlert dismissable withIcon>warning</WarningAlert>
```
