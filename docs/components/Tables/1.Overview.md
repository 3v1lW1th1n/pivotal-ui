The `Table` component is a robust component that offers a styled table. If the rows change, the content on the page will update.

Several enhanced Table components are also available:
* **SortableTable**: rows can be sorted ascending or descending by a chosen column.
* **FlexTable**: uses `div` tags to compose a table rather than traditional HTML tags.
* **SortableFlexTable**: a SortableTable that is composed of `div` tags.
* **AdvancedTable**: offers many additional features for advanced customization.

Tables can also be composed with any subset of the features offered by the **AdvancedTable**.
