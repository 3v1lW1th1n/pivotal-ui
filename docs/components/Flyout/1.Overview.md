The flyout appears from the right side of the window and overlays all other content until it is closed. Its
visibility is controlled with the `show` property. It can take a custom `width`. The contents of the header
and the body are set with the `header` and `children` properties, respectively. The behavior of the icon
button is defined through the `onHide` callback.

The flyout will overlay its first parent that has position `relative`.
