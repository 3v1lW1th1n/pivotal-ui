Forms handle layout, based on the [Flex Grid](/components/grids/overview) system, state, validation, and error handling so that the internal components don't have to worry about them.

The `Form` component works by building up a series of `FormRow` components, each containing one or more `FormCol`
components. You can use these to lay out the fields in your form, and to control your form state.

A `Form` will generally look like this:

```jsx harmony
::nonInteractive
<Form>
    <FormRow>
        <FormCol name="username">
            <Input/>
        </FormCol>
        {/*...some more cols...*/}
    </FormRow>
    {/*...some more rows and sub-cols...*/}
</Form>
```
