Expanders are collapsible content areas. Unlike their accordion counterparts, Expanders do not require a
parent collapse and child content structure. This means you can trigger the expanding and collapsing content from somewhere
else within the DOM.

The Expander component accepts an "onEntered" and an "onExited" callback that triggers after animation is complete.
