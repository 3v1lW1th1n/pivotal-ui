The Tooltip component is a styled container for content that should be displayed when triggered by an
OverlayTrigger or TooltipTrigger. It does not exhibit any dynamic behavior on its own.

TooltipTriggers are simpler to use, and their associated Tooltips are shown and hidden using CSS `visibility` rules.
In contrast to OverlayTriggers, the markup always exists in the DOM.
