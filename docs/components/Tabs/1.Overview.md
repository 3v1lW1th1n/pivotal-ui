Tabs are a navigation element used in web design that allow users to easily access different areas of a site or different parts of an individual page.

They’re like tabbed dividers in a filing cabinet – by clicking a tab, users can easily locate a view of related content. Tabs should be used for alternating between views within the same context, not to navigate to different areas.

Using Tab components in React consists of a parent element for the desired Tab type (for example,
`Tabs` or `LeftTabs`). Each `Tab` is a child of this parent element and has a `tab` property for the
string value a Tab should display.

Additionally, each `Tab` must define an `eventKey` property for uniquely identifying this tab to its parent component.
