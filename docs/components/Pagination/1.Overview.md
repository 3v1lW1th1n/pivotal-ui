Pagination is a method for allowing a user to view a subset of sorted data into a more comprehensible format. It allows a user to progress to the next or previous view, or choose a page number you want manually.

The `Pagination` component provides a styled list of links used to navigate through a paginated list.  By default,
the component includes a 'previous page' button, a 'next page' button, and one link.

The pagination component will display a maximum of five pages. When more than five are provided, the component will shrink with ellipses to show the first, last, active, and pages adjacent to the active page.
