Use a panel to logically group content that has the following form: header, body, and/or footer, and/or title. | Use a panel as a generic wrapping element. Instead, avail yourself of the various background color modifiers we have.
Use multiple panels or list-group inside to group a collection of related content objects. | Overload the panel header with too many calls to action.
Distinguish between primary and secondary CTAs in the title/header and footer (e.g., primary vs secondary buttons). | Use a panel when screen real estate is valuable, instead consider a table layout or grouped-list.
