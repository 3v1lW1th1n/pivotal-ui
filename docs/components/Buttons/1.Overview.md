Use buttons as triggers for actions that are used in forms, toolbars, and as stand-alone action triggers. Try to avoid the usage of buttons for navigation. The main difference between actions and navigation is that **Actions** are operations performed on objects, while **Navigation** refers to elements on the screen or view that take you to another context in the application. For **Navigation** consider simply using links.

The aria-label attribute will be populated with the button text, unless an aria-label value is explicitly supplied. Buttons side-by-side will be separated by a margin of `$base-unit`.
