Panels are often used to group related content. They include box headers, footers, and can be combined with any backgrounds.

Panels are typically a combination of contours, backgrounds, and content including headers and footers. This section describes the contours.

By default, all the `panel` does is apply basic padding to contain some content.

```html_example
<div class="panel bg-neutral-11">
  <div class="panel-body">
    Panel body content
  </div>
</div>
```

title: Panel with Box-Shadow
name: 02_panel_box_shadow
parent: panel
---

Adding the `box-shadow-1` to the `panel` lightly pops the panel off of the page. This is the preferred aesthetic instead of a border. This works great for pushing the panel up from the workspace. 

```html_example
<div class="panel bg-neutral-11 box-shadow-1">
  <div class="panel-header">
    <div class="panel-title">Panel Title</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Panel body content
  </div>
</div>
```

    <div class="panel-title-alt">Panel Title Alt</div>

  <div class="panel-footer">Panel footer content</div>
</div>

title: Panel with Loading Animation
name: 04_panel_loading_indicator
parent: panel
---

Add a loading animation to a panel with the class `panel-loading-indicator`. The animation is intended for panels that utilize
`panel-header` and `panel-body`. This should be used when the content of the panel is being generated asynchronously and youâ€™d like to communicate to the user that their content is on the way. 


```html_example
<div class="panel box-shadow-1">
  <div class="panel-header">
    <div class="panel-title-alt">Panel Title Alt</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <div class="panel-loading-indicator"></div>
    Look, I'm loading!
  </div>
</div>
```

The scrollable panel sets a fixed height of 184px and scrolls any content that is larger. If you want a different size, set an inline style on the `.panel-scrollable`.

```html_example
<div class="panel panel-scrollable bg-neutral-11">
  <div class="panel-body">
